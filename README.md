# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
Overview:
This project is a hands-on HR analytics dashboard built using Power BI Desktop.
It started as a learning journey by following a YouTube tutorial and turned into a full project that analyzes an organization's workforce through data.
The dashboard highlights key HR metrics such as total employees, gender distribution, job levels, years of service, promotion eligibility, and retrenchment status.
It combines data cleaning, modeling, and visualization to tell a story about employee dynamics inside the company.

Project Story:
When I began this project, my goal was simple: learn Power BI by building something practical.
I chose HR data because it offers rich insights that can impact real business decisions — from hiring strategies to employee engagement.
After importing the data, I transformed it using Power Query to ensure clean and structured datasets.
I then built relationships between tables to enable cross-filtering and calculated new fields using DAX to generate meaningful metrics.
Finally, I designed an interactive dashboard that lets users explore:
- Gender balance across the workforce
- Employee service years distribution
- How many employees are due for promotion or retrenchment
- Departmental trends in growth and attrition
- Performance ratings and overtime statistics

Key Insights:
As I analyzed the dashboard, some interesting patterns stood out:
- Out of 1,470 employees, 60% are male and 40% are female.
- Only 4.9% of employees are due for promotion, suggesting room for career growth planning.
- Most employees have 1–5 years of service, showing a relatively young workforce.
- The Research & Development and Sales departments have the highest numbers for both promotions and retrenchments.
- 84.63% of employees are rated as "High" performers — a strong positive indicator for HR.
- 92% of employees are actively on service, while 8% are flagged for retrenchment, supporting workforce optimization plans.
- 64% of employees live very close to work, which can influence remote work or relocation policies.
These insights demonstrate how much value lies hidden in HR data — and how Power BI can turn that data into actionable knowledge.

Tools Used:
Power BI Desktop
